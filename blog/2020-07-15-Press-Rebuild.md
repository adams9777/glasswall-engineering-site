## Glasswall Launches its Cloud-hosted File Regeneration Service ##
** An API delivering unparalleled CDR performance at scale, Glasswall Rebuild is a low cost, serverless service that regenerates safe, clean and visually identical files in seconds. 

London, May XX, 2020 - Glasswall, a leading Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) company, today announced the launch of Glasswall Rebuild, a cloud-hosted service that allows organisations to safely and securely import files and documents.

Wherever files are imported or stored, the threat of malicious content is constant. Whether from Active Content such as macros, JavaScript, embedded files or structural deviations from the published format specification, malware has no shortage of places to hide. As more and more employees work from home and remotely share more files and documents than ever before, increasing access further elevates this risk. Glasswall’s patented and award-winning technology meets that challenge.

Validated and deployed by government intelligence communities worldwide, Glasswall Rebuild verifies file types, resolves structural issues and removes high-risk Active Content by policy. Files are regenerated in seconds in either a dedicated or shared customer environment with a comprehensive analysis delivered with each regenerated file. 

Hosted on either a dedicated or shared customer environment, Glasswall Rebuild is easily integrated into any business process where organisations need to safely import files. Use cases are wide-ranging and include document-sharing for law firms and collection of documents for regulatory requirements by financial institutions. Priced by volume, Glasswall Rebuild is available on the Glasswall Store (glasswall-store.com) and AWS marketplace, and can be hosted in any AWS data centre globally.  

Danny Lopez, Glasswall CEO said, “Simply put, no other CDR technology matches Glasswall’s effectiveness and reliability. Our battle-hardened core engine is already trusted and deployed by the world’s most security-conscious organisations and Glasswall Rebuild now brings that unparalleled capability to the private sector as a service.”

Dinis Cruz, CISO and SVP Engineering added, "Glasswall Rebuild makes our technology more widely available to security teams, systems integrators and developers, and represents a major milestone for the company. We look forward to collaborating with our clients and partners to make their products and services even more secure".
