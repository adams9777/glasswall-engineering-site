These files have been created to show how glasswall rebuild protects against threats, but the original file content is saved. The files will all look the same before and after being put through file rebuild. All the files use features that can be also used by malware but the files are completely safe.

## Complete works of shakespeare jpg
​
This file is a jpg, but it actually is also a zip containing the complete works of shakespeare. To confirm this convert the file to a .zip file and then unzip using a program like 7zip. You are then able to see 31 files, shakespeares work! Once you run this through Glasswall rebuild, and repeat the steps as above, all the files will have been removed, leaving only the jpg of shakespeare.
